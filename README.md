Citation: Photosynthetic Capacity and Chlorophyll Fluorescence Potential of the Isodon rubescens Leaf back
Abstract: The upper side of the Isodon rubescens leaf normally faces the sun. The back of the leaves occasionally face upwards because of wind, rain or animal activity. The photosynthetic rates, light response curves and rapid light curves of the chlorophyll fluorescence of the leaf back and front were determined with a Li-6400 photosynthesis system and a PAM-2500 portable chlorophyll fluorescence apparatus in this study to clarify the photosynthetic capacity of the leaf back. The results showed that the leaf back possessed photosynthetic capacity. The photosynthetic capacity of the leaf back was slightly lower than that of the corresponding leaf front at the same light intensity. In general, the apparent quantum yield and the light saturation point of the leaf back were respectively lower than that of the corresponding leaf front. The light compensation point of the back of the leaf was slightly higher than that of the corresponding leaf front. The photosynthetic capacity of the back of the leaf was similar to that of the leaf front. I. rubescens can normally photosynthesize and grow when the leaf back is facing upward.
